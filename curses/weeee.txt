No dominion can survive without a stronghold of some sort. The
stronghold provides not only an administrative center for the
dominion, but also a secure place to store the dominion’s wealth
and to retreat to in times of war.
The area of land covered by a dominion is measured in Fiefs. A
single fief is an area of about 12 miles radius. If using hex maps,
this translates to a single 24-mile hex that contains the
stronghold, or a cluster of nine 8-mile hexes.
Usually, a dominion will consist of a single fief, with the stronghold
roughly in the center so that no point is too far away for easy
access.
A large stronghold with several external troop garrisons can
increase the effective dominion to anything up to seven fiefs (one
containing the stronghold and another six surrounding it).
However, the increased travel time needed for either troops to get
from the stronghold to an outlying village or for the villagers from
that village trying to seek refuge in the stronghold limits the
maximum size of the dominion to no larger than this.
If someone wishes to clear out more land and enlarge their
dominion beyond this size then they must build another
stronghold to protect the newly cleared land—and this then
becomes the center of a second dominion.
Before a stronghold can be built, the surrounding area must first
be cleared of monsters that would threaten the builders. This job
is ideally suited to adventuring parties.
Once the area is clear, the stronghold itself can be designed and
built. The building costs (in both money and time) for the different
components of a stronghold are listed in Section 9.
Terrain & Resources
In order to determine the resources available to a dominion, the
terrain of each fief must be determined.
If you are using 24-mile hexes, this is straightforward, as a single
map hex will equal a single fief. If you are using 8-mile hexes or
maps without hexes then you will have to classify each fief
according to its predominant terrain type.
Each fief is classified as either Civilized, Borderlands or
Wilderness, according to the Dominion Fief Classification table
below, depending on the terrain type of the fief and how close it is
to a major city or to other civilized fiefs. Note that the other
civilized fiefs don’t necessarily need to belong to the same
dominion or even the same country, as long as there are trade
links between them and the fief in question (which will usually be
the case, barring embargoes).No dominion can survive without a stronghold of
